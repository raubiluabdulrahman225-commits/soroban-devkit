# Quick Start — first-time user walkthrough

This guide takes a developer who has **never used `sdkt`** from zero to a working inspection, audit, and upgrade-safety comparison in under five minutes. Every command is copy-pasteable and runs **offline** (no RPC, no account, no network) unless stated otherwise.

If you only want to inspect a WASM, skip install: [Web Playground](https://sabolabs.github.io/soroban-devkit/playground/).

If you have not installed `sdkt` yet, follow [README § Quick Start](https://github.com/SaboLabs/soroban-devkit#quick-start) first. This document assumes `sdkt` is on your `PATH` and reports a version when you run `sdkt --version`.

> **Want the on-chain path next?** After this offline walkthrough, follow the [Testnet walkthrough](testnet-walkthrough.md) (identity → fund → deploy → invoke → events).

***

## Step 1 — Install

Choose **one** of the following.

**A. GitHub Release binary (no Rust toolchain required):**

1.  Open the [Releases](https://github.com/SaboLabs/soroban-devkit/releases) page and download the asset for your platform:

    | Platform              | Asset                                  |
    | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Linux (x86\_64)       | `sdkt-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
    | macOS (Intel)         | `sdkt-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`      |
    | macOS (Apple Silicon) | `sdkt-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`     |

    Windows: `cargo install sdkt-cli` (v2.5.0 has no Windows GitHub Release zip).

**A2. crates.io (Rust 1.88.0+):**

```bash
cargo install sdkt-cli
sdkt --version
```

2.  Extract and run:

    ```bash
    tar -xzf sdkt-<your-platform>.tar.gz
    chmod +x sdkt
    ./sdkt --version
    # Optional: make it available system-wide
    sudo mv sdkt /usr/local/bin/
    ```

**B. Build from source (requires Rust 1.88.0+):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaboLabs/soroban-devkit
cd soroban-devkit
cargo install --path crates/sdkt-cli
```

***

## Step 2 — Verify installation

```bash
sdkt --version
```

Expected output (version may be newer):

```
sdkt 2.5.0
```

Then confirm the CLI is responsive:

```bash
sdkt --help
```

This lists every top-level command and subcommand. `sdkt` commands are offline by default — only a handful (e.g. `inspect`, `storage`, `health`) need an RPC endpoint, and they say so explicitly.

***

## Step 3 — Inspect a WASM

`sdkt` can read the public ABI and metadata of any compiled Soroban contract WASM without a network. This repository ships two tiny fixtures you can use right now.

```bash
sdkt wasm inspect crates/sdkt-cli/tests/fixtures/us_old.wasm
```

What this command does:

* Parses the WASM binary and reports its **size** and **SHA-256 hash** (useful for verifying a deployed contract matches your build).
* Lists **custom sections** (e.g. `contractspecv0`, `contractenvmetav0`, `contractmetav0`) that Soroban attaches to every contract.
* Shows **exported functions** and the **Contract Spec** — the public functions, custom types, and events the contract exposes.

Example output:

```
WASM Inspection Report: crates/sdkt-cli/tests/fixtures/us_old.wasm
========================================
Size: 198 bytes
SHA-256 Hash: 05befa136e7f0829a5051d97b032f355a5e65976397df90b224d141942dce46c
Version: 1

Custom Sections (1):
  - contractspecv0

Exported Functions (0):

Contract Spec Available: Yes
  Functions: 2
    - fn transfer(1) -> 0
    - fn mint(1) -> 0
  Custom Types: 1
  Events: 1
```

The two functions `transfer` and `mint` are the contract's public interface. This is the same information a frontend or integrator would need to call it.

***

## Step 4 — Run an offline audit

`sdkt audit` performs static security analysis on contract **Rust source**, catching common mistakes before deployment. Point it at any contract's `src/lib.rs`. The example below audits a tiny throwaway contract written to a temporary file — no repository fixture is required.

```bash
cat > /tmp/example_contract.rs <<'EOF'
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address};

#[contract]
pub struct Token;

#[contractimpl]
impl Token {
    pub fn transfer(_from: Address, _to: Address, _amount: u64) {
        // NOTE: intentionally missing require_auth() — sdkt audit will flag this
    }
}
EOF

sdkt audit /tmp/example_contract.rs
```

Interpreting the output:

* `Severity: 0 critical, 0 warning, 0 info (0 total)` with `No issues found.` means the analyzer found nothing to flag.
* `critical` findings (e.g. `AUTH-001/002/003/004` — missing auth checks) should block a deploy.
* `warning` findings (e.g. `MOVE-001` — a possible move-after-use of a local) are heuristic and worth a look but are not necessarily bugs.
* JSON mode (`--format json`) emits the same result as structured data for CI.

Audit runs entirely offline and is safe to gate every pull request on. See [docs/examples.md](./) for the audit-on-PR recipe.

***

## Step 5 — Compare two contracts

Before upgrading a deployed contract, confirm the new WASM is **backwards-compatible** with what is already on-chain. `sdkt diff --upgrade-safety` diffs two WASM files and renders a breaking-change verdict.

```bash
sdkt diff \
  --old-wasm crates/sdkt-cli/tests/fixtures/us_old.wasm \
  --new-wasm crates/sdkt-cli/tests/fixtures/us_new.wasm \
  --upgrade-safety
```

How to read the verdict:

* `Compatible: YES` — the new contract keeps every function, event, and type the old one exposed (plus any additions). Safe to upgrade.
* `Compatible: NO` — at least one **Breaking** change was detected. The `Breaking:` block lists exactly what changed:
  * **Removed function / event / type** — something callers depended on is gone.
  * **Changed signature** — a function's arguments or return type changed.
* The `Non-breaking:` block lists safe additions (new functions, events, or types) that do not break existing integrators.

Example output:

```
Upgrade Safety
==============

Compatible: NO

Breaking:
  - Changed signature: mint()
  - Removed event: Transfer
  - Removed type: Point

Non-breaking:
  - Added function: balance()
  - Added event: Mint
  - Added type: Circle
```

This tells you the upgrade changes `mint()`'s signature and drops the `Transfer` event and `Point` type — a breaking change — while adding `balance()`, a `Mint` event, and a `Circle` type. Use `--deny-breaking` with `sdkt deploy` to abort an upgrade automatically if this verdict is `NO`.

***

## Step 5 — Sign a transaction (offline)

`sdkt` can sign a built transaction envelope with a local ED25519 identity, **without any network or secret exposure**. First create an identity, then build and sign an envelope.

```bash
# Create a local signing identity (stored in the keystore, never printed)
sdkt identity generate alice

# Build an unsigned envelope (offline; fee defaults to 100 stroops,
# override with --fee <STROPS>)
sdkt tx build \
  --source <SOURCE_ACCOUNT> \
  --sequence <SEQ> \
  --contract <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --function hello \
  --output unsigned.xdr

# Validate it offline, then review what you are about to sign
sdkt tx validate --envelope unsigned.xdr
sdkt tx decode unsigned.xdr

# Sign with the local identity (offline; --network selects the signature hash)
sdkt tx sign --input unsigned.xdr --output signed.xdr --identity alice --network testnet
```

The signed envelope in `signed.xdr` is ready to broadcast with `sdkt tx submit --envelope signed.xdr` (requires RPC) or any compatible Stellar client. Signing itself uses only the local keystore — no RPC call is made.

***

## Step 6 — Where to go next

You now know the three core offline workflows. Continue with:

* [**Testnet walkthrough**](testnet-walkthrough.md) — **on-chain loop**: identity → Friendbot fund → network profile → build → deploy → invoke → call → events / storage.
* [**Web Playground**](https://sabolabs.github.io/soroban-devkit/playground/) — inspect your own `.wasm` in the browser (no install).
* [**docs/examples.md**](./) — copy-paste recipes for every subcommand (decode, storage, tx, deploy) and CI gating patterns.
* [**docs/compatibility.md**](../compatibility/compatibility.md) — which real-world Soroban contracts `sdkt` is validated against, and the compatibility matrix.
* [**docs/ci-cd.md**](../compatibility/ci-cd.md) — wire `sdkt audit` and `sdkt diff --upgrade-safety` into GitHub Actions to block bad PRs and unsafe releases.

For the full command reference, see [docs/cli.md](../reference/cli.md). For build/install options and feature flags, see [docs/getting-started/installation.md](installation.md).
