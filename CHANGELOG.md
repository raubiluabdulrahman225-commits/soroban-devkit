## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Human-readable envelope viewer (`sdkt tx decode`).** `sdkt tx decode <xdr|file>` shows what an envelope does before it is signed or submitted: source, sequence, fee, memo, each operation (contract, function and arguments rendered in the `type:value` form `tx build --arg` accepts), the Soroban footprint and resources, and the attached signatures, naming the signer when its hint matches an account in the envelope. Fee-bump envelopes show the inner transaction plus the outer fee source and fee, kept as `i64` so it is never truncated. `--format json` emits a stable structured breakdown rather than raw XDR serde. Runs fully offline, and rejects invalid base64 and trailing bytes after the envelope, matching `tx validate`. Adds `decode_envelope` / `EnvelopeView` to `sdkt-xdr` (#77).
- **TTL extension plan from snapshot diff (`sdkt storage storage-diff --extend-plan`).** `sdkt storage storage-diff` compares two `StorageReport` JSON snapshots (output of `sdkt storage analyze --format json`) and now accepts `--extend-plan` to derive a non-mutating remediation plan from the diff. The plan lists the contract, the ledger keys covering removed (expired) and expiring-soon entries, a suggested `--ledgers` value, and a ready-to-run `sdkt storage extend` invocation. A diff with nothing to remediate reports an empty plan and exits 0. Available in both pretty and `--format json` output with stable field names. No transaction is built, signed, or submitted (#231).
- **Hash-only deployment submits the create transaction.** `sdkt deploy --wasm-hash` now uses the complete simulate, sign, submit, and poll flow after an earlier upload, and rejects prediction-only flags that cannot be resolved without the local WASM bytes (#70).
- **Composite values in `sdkt encode`.** `sdkt encode json:<JSON>` encodes one JSON value, including nested arrays and objects, as a single base64 XDR `ScVal` using the existing JSON to ScVal converter: arrays become `Vec`, objects become `Map` with `String` keys, `null` becomes `Void`, and integers use the smallest fitting `u32`/`u64`/`i32`/`i64`. `json:[1,2,3]` is one `Vec`, not three values. Invalid JSON fails with a message naming the input. The eleven `TYPE:VALUE` forms are unchanged (#235).
- **Install plugins from `.sdktplugin` bundles.** `sdkt plugin install <bundle>.sdktplugin` verifies the bundle's digests (and its Ed25519 signature, if present) before anything is written to the plugin store, then installs it. The bundle extension is matched case-insensitively, and `--id`, `--force`, and `--format` behave as they do for artifact installs. Output reports whether the bundle was signed (`signature: VERIFIED`/`UNSIGNED` in pretty output, a `signed` field in JSON), and unsigned bundles print a "NOT signed" note on stderr. `--public-key <file>` requires the bundle to be signed by that key: a mismatched key or an unsigned bundle is refused. Adds `install_bundle_with_key` to `sdkt-audit`. Non-bundle installs are unchanged (#213).
- **Explicit key classification in `sdkt storage analyze`.** `sdkt storage analyze` accepts repeatable explicit keys (`--key-xdr`/`--key`, `--map-key`, `--key-arg`, `--durability`) matching `storage read`. Each key is validated offline before RPC dispatch, fetched via `getLedgerEntries`, classified (`Instance`, `Persistent`, `Temporary`), and summarized with TTL rows alongside the contract instance singleton. Invocations without keys remain backward-compatible and output only the instance singleton (#217).
- **Offline contract storage estimation via `sdkt storage estimate`.** Added `sdkt storage estimate` to compute an offline baseline storage extension cost estimate for a contract WASM from its parsed `ContractSpec` ABI. Breaks down costs across Instance (1 guaranteed singleton entry), Persistent (runtime state cannot be determined from ABI alone, excluded from baseline), and Temporary (ephemeral) classes, with costs reported in both stroops and XLM using `calculate_extension_cost` (100 stroops/ledger/entry). Supports configurable ledger horizon (`--ledgers <N>`, defaulting to 17,280 ledgers), `--format json` with stable schema, and honest derivation metadata documenting the offline approximation ceiling (#214).
- **`sdkt storage restore`.** Recovers archived contract storage. It simulates the invocation that failed (`--envelope`), adopts the `restorePreamble` footprint and minimum resource fee, and signs and submits a `RestoreFootprint` transaction, reporting the tx hash, status, and number of restored keys in pretty and JSON output. `--dry-run` shows the keys and fee without submitting. A simulation with no preamble, or with an empty or malformed preamble footprint, fails with a clear error instead of submitting. Adds `build_restore_footprint_tx` / `RestoreFootprintParams` to `sdkt-xdr` and `restore_footprint` / `restore_params_from_simulation` to `sdkt-rpc`.
- **Build-only contract invocation via `sdkt invoke --build-only`.** `invoke` prepares and signs the transaction envelope (sequence fetch → simulate → adopt footprint/fee → sign) and prints it instead of submitting, so the exact bytes that would be sent can be inspected, or piped to `sdkt tx validate` / `sdkt tx submit`, without touching the network from the invoke path. `--format json` emits `envelopeXdr`, `fee`, `sequence`, and `submitted: false`. The mainnet safety guard still runs first (#73).
- **End-to-end plugin self-check via `sdkt plugin doctor`.** Added `sdkt plugin doctor` subcommand to perform structured diagnostic self-checks on installed plugins, directories, or `.sdktplugin` bundles across metadata, artifact presence, integrity, host compatibility (ABI), loader availability, and dry-run self-check execution. Halts on first failure, returns 0 for healthy or 1..=6 for the failed stage, supports `--format json`, and includes `--all` to diagnose all installed plugins (#173).
- **128-bit integer and byte encoding.** `sdkt encode` accepts decimal `u128`/`i128` and hexadecimal `bytes`, matching the runtime typed-argument parser on valid inputs. Invalid or out-of-range values fail with type/value diagnostics, and malformed Unicode byte input is rejected without panicking (#102).
- **Discovery of audit rules via `sdkt audit --list-rules`.** Added `--list-rules` flag to `sdkt audit` to discover all registered built-in rules with their ID, severity, and concise description without requiring a source file path. Supports `--format json` emitting a structured JSON array of rule metadata (`id`, `severity`, `description`), with deterministic registry ordering and immunity to `--disable` filters (#182).
- **Automatic execution of installed plugins during `sdkt audit`.** Installed plugins in the local plugin store run automatically during `sdkt audit` without requiring `--rules <id>`. `--rules` remains available for explicit rule selection and ad-hoc artifacts, and `--no-plugins` allows skipping installed plugins. Incompatible plugin ABIs emit a warning and are skipped without aborting the audit, and audits with plugins loaded display a rules summary line (#80).
- **Constructor argument support in `sdkt deploy`.** Added repeated `--arg <type:value>` flag to `sdkt deploy` accepting typed arguments (`u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64`, `u128`, `i128`, `bool`, `string`, `symbol`, `bytes`, `address`, or pre-encoded base64 ScVal). When constructor arguments are present, deployment uses Soroban's `HostFunction::CreateContractV2(CreateContractArgsV2)` for creation-time constructor execution. Zero-argument deployments preserve the existing `CreateContract` V1 path. Added `build_create_contract_v2_tx`, `build_create_contract_v2_tx_with_data`, and `build_create_contract_v2_tx_with_data_and_auth` builders to `sdkt-xdr` and updated auth entry parsing to handle `SorobanAuthorizedFunction::CreateContractV2HostFn` (#58).
- **Configurable event query ranges.** `sdkt events` accepts `--start-ledger <N>` and `--end-ledger <N>` flags to query specific ledger ranges. Ranges default to the prior 1000-ledger window if omitted, single bounds query from/to latest or relative windows, and inverted ranges (`start > end`) are rejected before RPC dispatch (#57).
- **Network-aware fee estimation for `sdkt tx build`.** `tx build` hard-coded a 100-stroop inclusion fee and never consulted the network, and emitted the envelope with no Soroban footprint at all, so the documented `tx build` → `tx sign` → `tx submit` workflow produced transactions the network rejects. Whenever the build already has a network to talk to — the operator named one (`--network-profile` / `--rpc-url` on `tx`), or the sequence is being auto-fetched — `build` now simulates the invocation and adopts the reported `minResourceFee` and footprint, mirroring `invoke`. A build that pins `--sequence` and names no network stays fully offline and unchanged, but now warns that the fee is inclusion-only. An explicit `--fee` still takes precedence and costs no network round trip. The simulate-and-adopt step is shared with `invoke` via the new `sdkt_rpc::simulate_invoke` (#76).
- **`sdkt plugin init`.** Scaffold a new audit rule project (standalone crate, derived rule id, native/WASM ABI files, `plugin.toml`, README, and unit tests) derived from `crates/sdkt-audit-example-rule`, so a plugin author goes straight to `cargo build --release --features plugins` without hand-copying the reference implementation (#95).
- **JSON output for plugin commands.** Every `sdkt plugin` subcommand (`list`, `show`, `install`, `remove`, `update`, `pack`, `verify-bundle`) accepts `--format json`. Stdout carries only the JSON document; the native-plugin warning and the unsigned-bundle note stay on stderr. (#54).
- **Actual fee and operation count in `sdkt tx inspect`.** Settled transactions now decode `resultXdr` and `envelopeXdr` to report the fee charged and number of operations in pretty and JSON output; pending/not-found or malformed XDR keeps those fields absent (#71).
- **Deployment fee breakdown in deploy output.** `sdkt deploy` exposes internal simulation fee calculations (`upload_fee`, `create_fee`, and `total_fee`) in `DeployResult` and displays them in both pretty and JSON output formats (#55).
- **Real Soroban contract deployment.** `sdkt` can deploy Wasm contracts to a live network (upload Wasm, create the contract instance, and report the resulting contract ID), replacing the previous placeholder/stub path.
- **Auto-generated deployment salt.** Deploy flows generate a salt when the operator does not supply one, so routine deployments no longer require a hand-crafted hex salt.
- **Contract TTL extension.** Operators can extend a contract instance’s TTL via the CLI/storage helpers.
- **Contract state read by LedgerKey.** Read on-chain contract state using a LedgerKey, for inspection and tooling workflows.
- **Friendbot funding.** Identity/account helpers can request Friendbot funding on supported test networks.
- **Read-only contract call.** `sdkt` can perform a read-only contract call against a live contract.
- **ABI-aware result decoding for contract call and simulation.** Call and transaction-simulation paths can decode results using contract ABI metadata when available.
- **Real account inspection.** Account inspection talks to the network and reports live account state instead of a stub.
- **State-changing contract invoke.** `sdkt invoke` submits state-changing contract invocations (with JSON output improvements noted under Fixed).
- **`sdkt doctor`.** New diagnostics command that checks local toolchain/environment readiness (CI- and Windows-safe checks).
- **Client generation and XDR encoding.** CLI support for generating clients and encoding XDR values, including `symbol:VALUE` as a Soroban `ScVal::Symbol` (values longer than 32 bytes fail with a clear error).
- **Local plugin ecosystem and signed plugin bundles.** Local plugin loading/ecosystem support, plus a signed, reproducible plugin bundle format with e2e/compatibility coverage.
- **On-chain inspection tooling.** Enriched on-chain contract inspection, upgrade-safety verification, live-contract ABI for events decode, and on-chain ABI for storage decode.
- **`tx simulate --abi-contract`.** Transaction simulation can now fetch a deployed contract's on-chain WASM and decode the primary result with its ABI, matching the existing `--abi-contract` support in `events`/`storage`. `--abi` and `--abi-contract` are mutually exclusive.
- **`call --abi-contract`.** Read-only calls can decode the result using the deployed contract's on-chain WASM (`inspect_contract` → `get_wasm_bytecode` → `parse_contract_spec`) instead of requiring a local artifact, matching `events`/`storage`/`tx simulate`. `--abi` and `--abi-contract` are mutually exclusive; local `--abi` and no-flag behavior are unchanged.
- **Windows x86_64 release binary.** Packaged Windows builds are available alongside existing platforms.
- **Website and Web Playground.** Public landing page and a browser-based contract inspector (Web Playground MVP).

### Fixed
- **Typed `bytes:` arguments report the same error as `sdkt encode`.** `call`, `invoke`, `deploy`, `tx build` and `storage read --key-arg` said `invalid hex byte in: <value>` for every bad `bytes:` value, while `sdkt encode` explained what was wrong. Both now share one hex decoder, so a non-ASCII value such as `bytes:a€` fails with `invalid bytes value: a€ (expected ASCII hex)` and exit code 1 on every command, and odd-length or non-hex input gets the matching specific message (#210).
- **Missing `--envelope` files are reported as missing.** `tx validate`, `tx simulate` and `tx submit` treated a nonexistent path as inline base64 and failed later with a decode or RPC error. They now share `tx sign`'s input resolver and fail with `invalid file '<path>': no such file or directory` before decoding or contacting the network. The resolver no longer mistakes inline base64 containing `/` for a path (#108).
- **`sdkt init` projects pass `cargo test`.** The scaffold's floating `soroban-sdk = "21.0.0"` resolved `soroban-env-host` 21.2.1, whose open `ed25519-dalek = ">=2.0.0"` range now picks 3.0.0 and breaks the `testutils` build (`ChaCha20Rng: CryptoRng` not satisfied); no published 21.x release avoids it. Generated projects now pin `soroban-sdk = "=27.0.6"` (its `soroban-env-host` bounds the range to `^2`) and declare `rust-version = "1.91"`, which that SDK requires; they build a `lib` alongside the `cdylib` so `tests/basic.rs` can link the crate, and register the contract with `env.register`. A new test runs `cargo check` and `cargo test` on a full generated project (#111).
- `sdkt project deploy --salt` is no longer silently ignored. The value was discarded and every contract got a random salt, so the same project produced different contract IDs on each run. The salt now uses the same 40-hex-char format and validation as `sdkt deploy --salt` and is forwarded to each deployment. The `"deploy"` string default is gone: omitting `--salt` auto-generates one, as before.
- Updated public landing page content (`website/index.html`) to reflect shipped CLI capabilities, adding contract invocation (`invoke` / `call`), event exploration, storage read/extend, account inspection, and Friendbot funding, updating the workflow to feature `invoke` as the primary execution path, adding a real `invoke` terminal demo, and fixing/expanding documentation footer links (#82).
- `sdkt identity delete` now fails with a not-found error, and exits non-zero, when the identity does not exist, instead of reporting a removal that did not happen. `IdentityStore::remove` returns `StorageError::NotFound` in that case, matching `network remove` (#109).
- `storage extend --ledgers` is documented as the relative TTL it is. The getting-started guides and the `ExtendFootprintParams::extend_to` doc comment described it as an absolute ledger sequence, but the protocol's `ExtendFootprintTTLOp.extendTo` means "at least N ledgers from the last closed ledger". Behaviour is unchanged; a regression test now pins that `N` reaches the operation as given (#110).
- Generated client arguments use the `i64:` type tag for `i64` parameters (#105).
- `sdkt deploy` now reports the file path and read error when its WASM file cannot be read (#49).
- Deploy salt validation distinguishes invalid length from invalid hex, with clearer error messages (#51).
- `sdkt invoke --format json` includes `errorResultXdr` when an RPC submission fails, matching the existing pretty output. The field is `null` when the RPC response has no error result XDR.
- RPC/XDR compatibility restorations for live Soroban LedgerEntry handling, on-chain inspection paths, and contract-instance TTL queries.
- Windows debug stack overflow avoided by running async main on an 8MB-stack thread.
- AUTH-004 audit rule registration/behavior improvements (plus additional AUTH/MOVE unit coverage).

### Changed
- Public docs refreshed for deployment, contributor onboarding, security-model wording, Windows availability, GitBook navigation, and README positioning. Historical internal/planning docs were archived or removed where appropriate.

## [v2.5.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Release polish & SCF readiness. Containerized distribution via a
  maintained multi-stage `Dockerfile` (+ `.dockerignore`); a conservative
  mainnet-safety guard on mutating RPC commands (`tx submit`, `deploy`,
  `project deploy`) that refuses mainnet unless the operator explicitly selects
  the network; `docs/scf.md` positioning the project for SCF grant tracks;
  refreshed `RELEASE_READINESS.md`; and opt-in `--version` provenance behind the
  new `provenance` feature (default OFF, so builds stay reproducible).
- **Shell completions. New `sdkt completions <shell>` command generates
  completion scripts for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `elvish`
  (via `clap_complete`). Documented in README and `docs/cli.md`.
- **CLI integration tests. New `crates/sdkt-cli/tests/cli_integration.rs`
  covers `--help`, `--version`, `completions`, the full `network`
  add/list/show/remove lifecycle with `--format json`, invalid-argument handling,
  and offline commands. Tests are deterministic and hermetic (per-test
  `SDKT_NETWORK_DIR`).
- **Supply-chain audit. New `supply-chain` CI job runs `cargo audit`
  directly (no third-party action) on `ubuntu-latest` with `continue-on-error`,
  so dependency advisories, advisory-DB, or network issues never break the
  build. Portable across the existing Linux/macOS/Windows test matrix.
- **Runnable crate doc examples. Added `///` doc examples to
  `sdkt_storage::NetworkProfile` and `sdkt_wasm::parse_metadata` so docs.rs
  renders verified, executable examples.
- **Contract dependency graph resolution** `.sdkt.toml` now supports an
  explicit `depends_on` field per `[contracts.<alias>]` (legacy `deploy_after`
  remains accepted and is merged with it). A single topological sort
  (`resolve_deploy_order`) is the source of truth shared by `sdkt build`,
  `sdkt project deploy`, and `sdkt lock generate`, giving deterministic,
  identical ordering across all three. The resolver validates the graph and
  returns clear, human-readable errors for: unknown dependency, self-dependency,
  duplicate dependency (same dep declared more than once), circular dependency,
  and duplicate contract name (TOML parse error now surfaced via `sdkt` instead
  of silently defaulting to an empty config). New unit tests cover each invalid
  case plus deterministic ordering; new CLI integration tests assert `sdkt build`
  fails fast on invalid graphs.
- **Local package manifest foundation. Foundation for a future
  package registry with **no** network or remote-registry functionality.
  `.sdkt.toml` now accepts a `[package]` section (`name`, `version`,
  optional `description`) and a `[dependencies]` table of **local path-only**
  references (`path = "..."`). New `sdkt package validate` validates the
  manifest offline: required `name`/`version` (semver-shaped), local-path-only
  dependencies (non-path sources like `git` are rejected at parse time via
  `deny_unknown_fields`), no self-dependency, existing `path` directories, and
  an acyclic dependency graph. The dependency-graph cycle/duplicate/self checks
  reuse the same Kahn's topological-sort core as contract deploy-order
  resolution (`sdkt_core::package::topo_sort`). Fully backward compatible, no
  breaking CLI changes, no version bump/tag/publish, no external services. New
  unit tests cover every validation error; new CLI integration tests cover valid
  and invalid manifests end-to-end.
- **Git dependency sources. Package dependencies now support both
  local `path` and `git` sources, exactly one per `[dependencies.<name>`. Git
  deps take a `git` URL plus exactly one of `tag` / `branch` / `rev`. Validation
  rejects `path` + `git` together, multiple git references, missing/empty git
  URL, unsupported schemes (`https`/`http`/`git`/`ssh` or `git@host:org/repo`),
  empty references, duplicate names, and cycles — reusing the existing resolver
  and shared `topo_sort`. New `sdkt package fetch` materializes dependencies
  into a deterministic `.sdkt-cache` via the system `git` CLI (no registry, no
  auth helpers, never builds; `--force` updates existing checkouts). A
  `DependencyFetcher` trait abstracts acquisition so a future registry source
  plugs in without touching callers. `sdkt.lock` now records each dependency's
  source, git URL, requested reference, and resolved commit SHA (local path
  deps unchanged). `LocalDependency` is retained as a type alias of `Dependency`
  for backward compatibility. Fully backward compatible: no breaking CLI
  changes, no version bump/tag/publish, no external service beyond git fetch.
  New unit tests cover parser/validation/lock serialization and fetch using
  on-the-fly local git repos (no network); new CLI integration tests cover
  validate-accept, validate-reject, and offline fetch end-to-end.
- **Lock dependency resolution & reproducible verification**
  `sdkt.lock` dependency entries now record the full resolved state for
  reproducibility: `name`, `source` (`local`/`git`), `original_source` (the
  resolved path or git URL), `git_url`, the requested `resolved_reference`
  (`tag`/`branch`/`rev`), the `commit_sha` resolved at fetch time, the on-disk
  `cache_location`, and an `integrity` hash (`sha256:<hex>` of the cached git
  tree or the local directory tree, computed offline). `sdkt package fetch`
  writes these fields into `sdkt.lock` (updating it in place when one already
  exists, preserving contract artifacts). New `verify_dependencies` reports a
  structured [`DepVerifyReport`] instead of panicking: it confirms the lock
  matches the manifest (source + reference), local `path` deps still exist,
  and cached git checkouts resolve to the locked commit. `sdkt lock verify`
  now verifies package dependencies **in addition to** contract artifacts —
  printing `✓ package dependencies verified` when consistent, or listing
  every drift (missing-in-lock, source-changed, reference-changed,
  path-missing, cache-missing, commit-mismatch, integrity-mismatch,
  not-in-manifest). Fully offline and advisory (never blocks the build). No
  registry, no network, no new dependency-graph or validation code — it reuses
  the existing [`crate::package::validate_dependencies`] and the
  `GitFetcher`/`git_cache_key` infrastructure. New unit tests cover
  dependency lock round-trip (incl. new fields), consistent verification, path
  missing, source/reference drift, not-in-manifest, and git cache-mismatch;
  new CLI integration tests cover `lock verify` dependency reporting and
  `package fetch` writing reproducible lock entries.

- **Package update & synchronization. New `sdkt package update`
  closes the package loop (`validate → fetch → update → verify`). It resolves
  each git dependency's currently available commit via `git ls-remote`
  (offline for local URLs; contacts only the declared git remote when a
  network ref is required), then refreshes `tag`/`branch` deps to the latest
  commit, updates the cache, and rewrites `sdkt.lock` (`commit_sha`,
  `resolved_reference`, `cache_location`, `integrity`) — preserving contract
  artifacts, hashes, and deploy order. `rev` deps are reported `pinned` and
  never updated; local `path` deps are reported `unchanged`. Flags:
  `--check` (report-only, exits 0), `--dry-run` (preview, touches nothing),
  `--format pretty|json` (JSON emits `checked`/`updated`/`unchanged`/`changes`).
  Clear, non-panicking errors for missing cache, git unavailable, invalid
  manifest, missing lock, detached branch, unknown reference, and network
  failure. Reuses `GitFetcher`, `git_cache_key`, `lock_dependencies`,
  `verify_dependencies`, and the existing cache/lock infrastructure — no new
  dependency-graph, topo-sort, validation, hashing, or git-cache code. New
  unit tests cover branch/tag/rev update, dry-run, check mode, JSON output,
  lock refresh, unchanged dep, update-after-fetch, missing cache, and invalid
  new CLI integration tests cover `package update`, `--check`, `--dry-run`,
  `--format json`, and offline local-path behavior.

- **Dependency version resolution. Git dependencies may now declare an
  optional semver `version` constraint (e.g. `version = ">=1.0, <2"`) instead
  of a fixed `tag`/`branch`/`rev`. When a constraint is set without an explicit
  ref, `sdkt package fetch` / `sdkt package update` resolve the **highest
  remote tag that satisfies the constraint** (via `git ls-remote --tags`,
  offline for local remotes) and materialize / lock that exact tag. An explicit
  `tag`/`branch`/`rev` still takes precedence and the constraint is ignored
  (mirroring how `rev`/`path` deps bypass version resolution). `sdkt package
  update --check` reports `constraint unsatisfied` when no tag matches; the
  lock records the resolved `version` for audit. Reuses the existing
  `git_cache_key` / `GitFetcher` / `lock_dependencies_resolved` infrastructure
  and adds a single pure `VersionResolver::best_version_match` (semver crate)
  as the one source of truth for constraint matching — no dependency-graph,
  validation, or fetch logic duplicated. New unit tests cover resolver
  selection, update detection, up-to-date, and unsatisfied-constraint; new CLI
  integration tests cover fetch/update picking the highest satisfying tag and a
  clear error on an unsatisfiable constraint.
- **Offline packaging & publish readiness. New `sdkt package pack`
  bundles the fully resolved project (`.sdkt.toml` + `sdkt.lock` + cached git
  checkouts under `.sdkt-cache/git/<key>`) into a portable offline artifact,
  either a compressed tarball (`--format tar.zst`) or a directory tree
  (`--format dir`), into `--out` (default `./dist`). Each artifact embeds a
  `package.json` `PackageBundle` descriptor recording the package name/version,
  chosen format, the `sdkt.lock` sha256, and per-dependency `source`/`git_url`/
  `commit_sha`/`integrity`/`cache_key`/`version` so the bundle is verifiable
  offline. New `sdkt package publish --dry-run` validates publish readiness
  (read-only) reusing the existing `verify_dependencies` / manifest-validation /
  cache / integrity primitives; it detects missing cache, lock drift, integrity
  mismatch, commit mismatch, reference change, and invalid package state.
  `--broadcast` is opt-in and rejected because this release defines no registry source
  (no network, nothing published). New `unpack` + `verify_bundle_equivalence`
  prove a reconstructed tree reproduces the original lock sha256 and per-git
  integrity exactly. Adds `tar` / `zstd` deps. New unit tests cover pack
  round-trip (dir + tar.zst), unknown-format rejection, and publish readiness
  (ready / missing-cache drift); new CLI integration tests cover `pack`,
  `pack --out`, format handling, pack→unpack→lock/integrity equivalence,
  `publish --dry-run` success, `publish --dry-run` failure on drift, and fully
  offline operation. No version bump, no tag, no publish, no registry server.

### Planned
- Post-2.0 mainnet-focused tooling, SCF grant alignment, and a plugin marketplace.

## [v2.4.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Network Profiles. Named network profiles let you
  save RPC URL + network passphrase once and reference them from any RPC
  command, instead of repeating full endpoints.

  - **Network Profile Storage (`sdkt-storage`):** new `NetworkStore`
    (honors `SDKT_NETWORK_DIR`) and `NetworkProfile` types with `add` / `get` /
    `list` / `remove` / `exists`. Stored as JSON under the project config dir
    (`~/.config/sdkt/networks`, overridable via `SDKT_NETWORK_DIR`). Validation
    rejects empty names, path separators in names, and empty RPC URLs.
  - **Network Profile CLI (`sdkt network`):** `sdkt network add |
    list | show | remove` manage profiles; `show --format json` for scripting.
    Additive, no breaking changes to existing commands.
  - **Network Profile Integration:** every RPC command now accepts
    `--network-profile <NAME>` plus explicit `--rpc-url <URL>` and
    `--network-passphrase <PASSPHRASE>` override flags. Resolution precedence
    (highest wins): explicit `--rpc-url` / `--network-passphrase` >
    `--network-profile` > `.sdkt.toml` `[network]` > `NetworkConfig::default()`.
    Commands covered: `inspect`, `verify`, `health`, `storage`, `events`,
    `account`, `tx`, `fee`, `wasm`, `deploy`, `project deploy`. Commands without
    the flag behave exactly as before. `tx sign` is excluded (offline signing).

### Changed
- Documentation: `docs/cli.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/examples.md` document the
  `sdkt network` command and the `--network-profile` / `--rpc-url` /
  `--network-passphrase` flags and their precedence.

### Testing
- Pure precedence logic covered by unit tests (`resolver_tests`) in `sdkt-cli`
  (flags > profile > built-in defaults). Integration tests under
  `crates/sdkt-cli/tests/network_cli.rs` cover the `sdkt network` management
  surface and a deterministic profile-not-found path; all tests are CI-safe
  (no live RPC, no internet, no machine-specific config).


## [v2.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Native transaction signing** `sdkt` can now sign Soroban transaction envelopes with a local ED25519 identity — completing the build → sign → submit lifecycle.
  - New `sdkt tx sign` command: signs a base64 `TransactionEnvelope` (or a file containing one) using an identity from the local keystore, appending a `DecoratedSignature`. Fully offline — no RPC, no secret exposure.
  - Flags: `--input <xdr|file>`, `--output <file>` (prints to stdout if omitted), `--identity <name>` (defaults to `default`), `--network testnet|mainnet|futurenet|custom:<passphrase>`, `--format json|pretty`.
  - Core signing library in `sdkt-xdr` (`sign_transaction`, `sign_envelope_with`, `verify_signature`, `Ed25519Signer`, `Network`, `Signer`, `SigningOptions`, `SigningError`) — dependency-clean and reusable by future signers (hardware/remote, deferred).
  - Keystore integration: `sdkt-storage::IdentityStore::load_signing_key(name)` exposes the in-memory `ed25519_dalek::SigningKey` for signing without serializing secrets.

### Changed
- `sdkt tx validate` and `sdkt tx sign` are now first-class `tx` subcommands documented across README, `docs/cli.md`, and `docs/examples.md`.
- Documentation: README, quick-start, CLI reference, and examples now show the complete build → validate → simulate → sign → submit workflow.

### Fixed
- Stabilized the `sdkt-cli` identity lifecycle integration test (`test_cli_identity_lifecycle`), which was intermittently failing under parallel `cargo test --workspace` due to a process-global `HOME` mutation. The test now redirects the keystore via a per-subprocess `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, eliminating the flakiness without weakening coverage.

### Security
- Signing derives the canonical envelope hash via `stellar_xdr`'s `TransactionEnvelope::hash(network_id)` (version-correct preimage construction) — no hand-rolled `HashIdPreimage`.
- Secret key material is handled only as in-memory `ed25519_dalek::SigningKey` values for the duration of a single sign call. No secret bytes are ever written to logs, `stdout`, `stderr`, or error messages; `SigningError` carries only key-free text.

### Testing
- `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass (280 tests, 0 failed).
- New coverage: 12 unit tests in `sdkt-xdr` (network handling, single/double signature append, golden-vector determinism, cross-network divergence, invalid base64/XDR/empty/envelope, invalid/unknown secret key, secret-key roundtrip, wrong-signer rejection) + 10 `sdkt-cli` integration tests for `tx sign` (success → file/stdout/json, success cases, unknown/missing identity, invalid file/base64/envelope, invalid network, unwritable output).

## [v2.1.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **Release consistency hardening.. Aligned the workspace version (`[workspace.package].version`) and every crate's pinned version to `2.1.1`. Fixed a packaging drift where `Cargo.lock` still pinned crates to `2.0.0` after the workspace version was bumped.
- Added CI guardrails in `release.yml` so a release tag must exactly match the Cargo workspace version, and the built binary's reported version must match the tag (catches version-drift regressions before publish).
- `docs/*`: refreshed version references and benchmark dates to `2.1.1`.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **Transaction Simulation Enhancements . Improved `sdkt tx simulate` to deserialize and display modern RPC metadata:
  - Added support for `restorePreamble` (surfaced when expired state restoration is required).
  - Added support for `stateChanges` tracking.
  - Enhanced human-readable CLI formatting to display these new fields along with operation counts. Backward compatibility with older RPC payloads is fully preserved.
- **RPC Connection Pooling . Replaced one-off HTTP clients with a single persistent, internally pooled `reqwest::Client` in `SorobanRpcClient`. This significantly improves performance during multi-contract orchestrated deployments (`sdkt project deploy`) by preventing socket exhaustion. Introduced configurable `timeout_secs` and `pool_max_idle_per_host` in `NetworkConfig`.
- **Offline command benchmark suite** `scripts/bench_offline.sh` plus a documented regression baseline (`docs/performance.md`).
- **Real-world Soroban compatibility matrix + workflow** `docs/compatibility.md` validates `sdkt` against official `stellar/soroban-examples` contracts; `.github/workflows/compatibility.yml` clones the examples read-only, builds a representative subset to WASM, and runs `sdkt` offline commands against the real artifacts (fails on any non-zero exit).
- **Project scaffolding hardening** generated project `Cargo.toml` resolves cleanly and pins `soroban-sdk` to `21.0.0` for fresh builds.
- **Release hardening** release smoke tests and SHA-256 checksums; GitHub Release distribution of binaries + checksums; tarball-content regression guard; `install.sh` checksum fallback for missing standalone `.sha256` assets
- **Adoption / docs** expanded usage examples and security guidelines, and improved the public install experience.

### Changed
- Workspace version bumped `2.0.0` → `2.1.0`.

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING: CLI Rename.. The executable binary has been officially renamed from `sdkt-cli` to `sdkt`.
  - Automation scripts, alias configurations, and CI pipelines explicitly expecting `sdkt-cli` must be updated.
  - End-users running `cargo install` will now receive an executable named `sdkt`.
  - Documentation and CI references updated appropriately.
- **WebAssembly (WASM) plugin loading** for `sdkt audit` Phase C. Sandboxed, platform-independent `.wasm` plugins can now be loaded via `sdkt audit <src> --rules <plugin.wasm>`.
- Extism runtime integration via the `wasm-plugins` feature (requires `wasm32-wasip1` target for plugin authors).
- JSON-over-memory WASM ABI boundary ensuring memory safety and isolation.
- **Native dynamic plugin loading** for `sdkt audit` Phase B. Native shared
  libraries (`.so` / `.dylib` / `.dll`) exporting the C-ABI plugin symbols can
  now be loaded at runtime via `sdkt audit <src> --rules <plugin.so>`.
- `sdkt-audit` plugin ABI: `plugin_abi` module with `#[repr(C)]` types
  (`SdktAuditFindingC`, `SdktAuditReportC`), `SDKT_AUDIT_ABI_MAJOR`/`MINOR`
  versioning, and the C-ABI symbol contract.
- `sdkt-audit-example-rule` gains `plugins` and `wasm-plugins` features producing loadable artifacts (`libsdkt_audit_example_rule` and `sdkt_audit_example_rule.wasm`).
- CLI: `--rules` now accepts plugin artifacts (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`/`.wasm`) when built
  with `--features plugins` or `--features wasm-plugins`; a clear error is emitted on a default (plugin-less) build.
  Validates `--rules` paths before reading the source (preserves the
  existing "does not exist" error contract).
- Tests: `plugin_loader` unit tests (ABI pack/unpack, severity mapping, missing
  file rejection) and a `sdkt-cli` integration test that builds the example
  plugin and verifies dynamic rules fire alongside built-ins.

### Changed
- **MSRV increased to `1.88.0`**. Required by transitive dependencies (`darling@0.23.x` via `serde_with`, and `stellar-strkey@0.0.18`), not by internal project code.
- `sdkt-audit` exposes `scan_all_functions_str` (convenience for plugin authors).
- No `AuditRule` public-API change. Default build is byte-for-byte identical to
  v1.0.0 — the `plugins` feature is OFF by default.

### Security
- Dynamic plugins run **in-process**; only load plugins you trust / built
  yourself. ABI major-version mismatch is rejected. See `SECURITY.md`.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-08-05 — First Stable Release

This is the first stable, semver `1.0.0` release. No new features beyond
the previous release; this release stabilizes the toolkit, unifies the version, and makes
the release pipeline fully green end-to-end.

### Added
- Stable `1.0.0` release tag. The full feature set is now
  considered stable: inspect/decode, storage TTL + analysis, ABI-aware
  decoding, transaction simulate/submit/build, events, account, fee
  estimate, WASM metadata/cache, offline ABI/WASM diff with upgrade-safety
  verdict, static security audit (`sdkt audit`), keystore (`sdkt identity`),
  project scaffolding (`sdkt init`), and deploy with optional
  `--deny-breaking` guard.
- Reusable GitHub composite Action (`.github/actions/sdkt`) for
  `audit` / `upgrade-safety` CI gates.

### Changed
- Workspace version bumped `0.17.0-alpha` → `1.0.0` (single source of truth
  in `[workspace.package]`). All crates and internal path-dependencies now
  pin `1.0.0`.
- `sdkt-audit-example-rule` is now publishable (was `publish = false`), so
  `sdkt-cli`'s optional `plugins` feature resolves on crates.io. Added to the
  release publish order before `sdkt-cli`.
- `release.yml`: `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` guard moved from a job-level `if:`
  (invalid — GitHub rejects `secrets` in `if:`) to a step-level `if:`.
  Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual dry-run verification. Removed the
  `--allow-dirty` flag from `cargo publish` so a dirty tree fails the release.
- `sdkt-action-ci.yml`: push trigger generalized `feat/milestone-15` → `feat/*`.
- Documentation refreshed: ROADMAP marks v1.0.0 released; `docs/ci-cd.md`
  and the composite Action default to the `v1.0.0` tag.

### Testing
- `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass (219 tests, 0 failed).
- `cargo publish --dry-run --workspace` packages all 8 crates cleanly.

---

## [v0.17.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (Plugin System Phase A)

### Added (extensibility, no breaking changes)
- **`RuleRegistry`** in `sdkt-audit`: `register_rule`, `register_builtin_rules`, `registered_rules`, `run_all`. Built-in rules (AUTH-001/002/003, MOVE-001) now register through the registry instead of a hardcoded list; finding order and IDs unchanged.
- **Plugin author API**: stable `AuditRule`, `AuditContext`, `Finding`, plus a `register_rule!` macro and process-wide `register_rule()` for external/plugin rules.
- **`sdkt audit --rules <PATH>`** (repeatable, additive): validates external rule paths and runs all registered rules. Omitted → behavior identical to the previous release. (Phase A: external rules must be compiled into the binary; dynamic loading is Phase B.)
- **Example plugin crate** `sdkt-audit-example-rule` (rule `EXAMPLE-001`) demonstrating the authoring workflow; linked only when `sdkt-cli` is built with the `plugins` feature (off by default).
- **`docs/plugin-authoring.md`**: architecture, rule lifecycle, authoring, registration, and testing guidance.

### Changed
- Workspace version bumped `0.16.0-alpha` → `0.17.0-alpha` (single source of truth).

### Testing
- Added unit tests (registry registration, duplicate de-duplication, ordering, builtin count) and integration tests (registry executes built-ins + external rules, `--rules` accepted/validated, example rule fires under the `plugins` feature). All prior 219 tests preserved.

---

## [v0.16.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (Release Engineering & Polish)

### Changed (release readiness, no new features)
- **Unified workspace version** — added `[workspace.package]` as the single source of truth (`version = 0.16.0-alpha`, `edition`, `license`, `authors`, `repository`, `homepage`). All 7 crates inherit via `*.workspace = true`; internal path-dependencies pinned to the unified version. Removes the `0.6.0-alpha` vs `v0.15.0-alpha` drift.
- **CI Action install fixed** — `action.yml` now installs `sdkt` from a real git tag (`cargo install --git ... --tag <sdkt-version>`, default `v0.15.0-alpha`) instead of a never-published crates.io version; swapped deprecated `actions-rs/toolchain` for `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`. Inputs unchanged (backward compatible).
- **Release workflow** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` on `v*` tags: fmt/clippy/test validation, `cargo publish --dry-run` per crate, cross-platform binary build (linux / macOS Intel / macOS Apple Silicon) uploaded to a GitHub Release, and ordered `cargo publish` (needs `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`).
- **`.gitignore`** — removed the contradictory `Cargo.lock` ignore (it is intentionally tracked; the Action installs with `--locked`).
- **Docs** — `README.md` rewritten (real repo URL, all 13+ subcommands, install, CI link); `docs/cli.md` rewritten to the full current command tree.
- **Panic audit** — replaced `unwrap()`/`expect()` on user-input execution paths (the `fee estimate` manual-arg parser and JSON-serialize `println!` sites) with `?`/`map_err` so malformed input returns a clean error instead of panicking. Internal invariants and test code untouched.

## [v0.15.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (CI/CD GitHub Action)

### Added
- **Reusable GitHub composite Action** — `.github/actions/sdkt/action.yml` wraps existing `sdkt` capabilities for CI: `command: audit` runs `sdkt audit <target> --format json` and fails when findings meet `severity-threshold` (default `critical`, so `MOVE-001` warnings never break CI); `command: upgrade-safety` runs `sdkt diff --old-wasm <old> --new-wasm <new> --upgrade-safety --format json` and fails when `compatible == false`.
- **Action self-validation workflow** — `.github/workflows/sdkt-action-ci.yml` exercises the composite Action against the committed WASM fixtures: a breaking diff (`us_old.wasm` → `us_new.wasm`) is asserted to fail, and an identical diff is asserted to pass.
- **Documentation** — `docs/ci-cd.md` with copy-paste workflow examples (audit-on-PR, upgrade-safety-on-release, self-validation) plus install/threshold notes.
- Packaging only: no new crate, no Rust changes, no breaking API changes. Reuses the existing `sdkt audit` and the existing `sdkt diff --upgrade-safety` JSON contracts.

## [v0.14.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (Upgrade Safety Guard)

### Added
- **`sdkt diff --upgrade-safety`** — transforms the existing `SpecDiff` into an actionable `UpgradeVerdict`: `breaking_changes` (removed function, changed signature, removed event, removed type) vs `non_breaking_changes` (additions). Pretty + JSON via existing `--format`.
- `sdkt-wasm`: `UpgradeVerdict`, `VerdictChange`, `ChangeKind`, `upgrade_safety()` / `upgrade_safety_wasm()` — all derived from the existing `diff_specs`/`SpecDiff` (no duplicated comparison logic).
- **`sdkt deploy --deny-breaking --old-wasm <deployed.wasm>`** — optional deploy guard that aborts when the upgrade is not backwards-compatible. Off by default; existing `deploy` behavior unchanged when the flag is omitted.
- 6 unit tests (`upgrade_safety`: removed fn, changed signature, removed event, removed type, additions-only, identical) + 5 `sdkt-cli` integration tests (pretty, JSON, `deploy --deny-breaking`).
- Additive, backwards-compatible: new types + new flags only; no breaking API changes.

## [v0.13.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (Gap C: Static Security Analysis)

### Added
- **`sdkt audit <path>`** — offline static security analysis of a Soroban contract Rust source. Flags `AUTH-001` (missing `require_auth` on privileged fns), `AUTH-002` (unauthenticated `invoke_contract`), `AUTH-003` (unguarded `initialize`), and `MOVE-001` (suspicious move-after-use, Warning only). Pretty + JSON via existing `--format`.
- New crate **`sdkt-audit`**: `Severity`, `Finding`, `AuditReport`, `AuditRule` trait, `audit_source()` / `audit_source_with()` / `audit_source_with_spec()` (reuses `sdkt-wasm::ContractSpec` for cross-checking). Built-in rules are additive and `--disable`-able.
- 13 unit tests (per-rule positives/negatives, disable, clean, parse-error) + 6 `sdkt-cli` integration tests for `audit`.
- Additive, backwards-compatible: new crate + new CLI subcommand; no breaking API changes; `sdkt-core` remains networking-free.

## [v0.12.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (Contract ABI/WASM Diff)

### Added
- **`sdkt diff --old-wasm <A> --new-wasm <B>`** — offline comparison of two contract WASM binaries. Reports added/removed functions, changed function signatures, added/removed events, and added/removed custom types. Pretty + JSON via existing `OutputFormat`.
- `sdkt-wasm`: new `spec_diff` module with `diff_wasm()` / `diff_specs()` and a serializable `SpecDiff` report (per-WASM SHA-256 hash + size context). Reuses the existing `parse_contract_spec` parser.
- 7 unit tests (added/removed/changed functions, events, types, identical-spec, parse-error propagation) + 3 `sdkt-cli` integration tests for `diff`.
- Additive, backwards-compatible: new module + re-exports; no breaking API changes; no new crates.

## [v0.11.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (StorageAnalyzer)

### Added (finish StorageAnalyzer)
- **`sdkt storage analyze <contract-id>`** — categorizes a contract's storage into Instance / Persistent / Temporary entries, with a TTL summary and per-entry detail. Pretty + JSON via existing `OutputFormat`.
- `sdkt-storage`: real Instance/Persistent/Temporary classification by decoding the XDR `LedgerKey` (`StorageClass`); `StorageEntry` per-entry detail added to `StorageReport`.
- 5 unit tests (classification round-trips for instance/persistent/temporary/invalid) + 3 `sdkt-cli` integration tests for `storage analyze`.
- Additive, backwards-compatible: `StorageReport` gains `total_entries`, `other_entries`, `entries` (serde-defaulted) — no breaking changes.


## [v0.10.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05 (ABI-aware decoding)

### Added
- **ABI-aware decoding**: `--abi <WASM>` flag on `events`, `inspect`, and `storage check`.
- `sdkt-wasm` `ContractSpec` parser; `sdkt-xdr::decode_event_topics` for event topic/value decoding.
- Real base64 XDR event topic + data-value decoding (previously a no-op stub).
- `sdkt_xdr::scval_from_base64` helper for decoding event payloads.
- ABI functions/events/custom-types display in pretty + JSON output.

### Fixed
- `events --abi` now decodes actual topics/value instead of empty vectors.
- Removed accidentally-committed 4.6 MB `gen_keys` binary; added to `.gitignore`.
- Clippy-clean (`-D warnings`) across workspace.

## [v0.9.0-alpha] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **WASM tooling**: `sdkt wasm metadata` and `sdkt wasm cache` (info/remove/clear).
- `sdkt-wasm` crate: `ContractSpec` parser for `contractspecv0` / `contractenvmetav0` sections.
- `sdkt deploy` (upload WASM + instantiate) and `sdkt init` project scaffolding engine.
- WASM metadata caching in `sdkt-storage` (`WasmCache`).
- Identity/keystore foundation reused by deploy/init flows.

## [v0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-08-04 (Mutability Foundation)

### Added
- **Transaction simulation**: `sdkt tx simulate` (offline pre-flight via `simulateTransaction`).
- **Transaction submission**: `sdkt tx submit` with optional wait/poll (`submit_and_wait`).
- **Identity / keystore**: `sdkt identity` generate/import/list/show/delete/default (ED25519, `~/.sdkt/identities`).
- **Envelope builder**: `sdkt tx build` (typed arg parsing → base64 XDR envelope).
- **Fee estimation**: `sdkt fee estimate` (RPC dynamic fee or manual base-fee samples).
- Validation module (`sdkt_core::validation`) for offline envelope checks.

## [v0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Horizon account enrichment**: `sdkt account` now pulls balances, signers, and associated assets via Stellar Horizon REST.
- **ScVal pretty-print UI**: human-readable ScVal rendering in CLI pretty output (improved readability for events/storage values).

## [v0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-08-04

### Improved
- **Production Readiness**: Hardened `sdkt-rpc` client timeout handling and mapping boundaries.
- **RPC Resilience**: Added internal retry mechanisms to gracefully handle short-lived network interruptions.
- **Documentation Quality**: Maximum structural rustdoc coverage across core workspace crates and updated README with benchmark planning.

### Testing
- Validation completed on workspace boundaries with Clippy strict policies.
- CLI integration tests increased to cover transaction, storage, and account edge-cases.

### Internal
- Workspace DRY cleanups (unified generic `.request()` methods).
- GitHub Actions workflow added to execute formatting and clippy automated checks.

## [v0.5.0-alpha] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Transaction Inspection**: `sdkt tx inspect` command to view transaction hash, status, ledger inclusion, and operation counts.
- **Event Explorer**: `sdkt events` command to fetch and list emitted Soroban contract events.
- **Account Inspection**: `sdkt account` command for base level diagnostics of Stellar/Soroban accounts.
- **Generic RPC request abstraction**: `SorobanRpcClient` now exposes a public `request()` method for generic JSON-RPC interactions.
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite coverage added for `tx`, `events`, and `account` commands using `assert_cmd`.

### Improved
- **CLI Architecture**: Hardened separation between CLI output formatting and RPC business logic.
- **RPC Abstraction**: Centralized API request formatting and internal error handling mapping inside the RPC crate.
- **Documentation**: Substantial overhaul of README.md and internal documentation outlining workspace boundaries.

### Internal
- Workspace cleanup, dependency deduplication, and module flattening.
- Implemented robust struct-based API boundaries in `sdkt-rpc`.
- Enforced 100% strict test coverage mapping for CLI boundaries.

## [v0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- Initial Soroban RPC inspection tools (`sdkt inspect`).
- Base64 XDR parser via `sdkt-xdr` (`sdkt decode`).
- Storage TTL analysis (`sdkt storage check`).
- Basic workspace architecture and integration testing.

## [Unreleased]

No unreleased changes. AUTH-004 registration and the plugin bundle CLI (`pack` /
`verify-bundle`) shipped in `v2.5.0`.
